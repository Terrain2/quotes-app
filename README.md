# What is this?
It's a thing i made while [learning flutter/dart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqePcMyeoIY&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ&index=21), and i spent so much time on it so i'm way too proud not to publish it

As you can see on the actual tutorial, i wasn't actually meant to do more than add a delete button, but i did! and i'm proud of that!

# Building
Honestly, i have no idea, but i'm pretty sure you just need to ``flutter pub get`` and then it should work fine, i guess you probably also need to point your IDE (Android Studio, in my case) to your Flutter SDK
